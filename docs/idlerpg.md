# IdleRPG plugin

The `idlerpg` plugin is an XMPP MUC adaptation of the classic IRC IdleRPG game.
Players register a character in a room, stay online, and level up by idling.
Normal room messages add penalty time to the player's timer.

The game is room-scoped. Each room has its own players, timers, items and quest
state.

## Enable the game

Room owners/admins can enable or disable IdleRPG like other room plugins:

```text
,rooms enable <room_jid> idlerpg
,rooms disable <room_jid> idlerpg
```

From a MUC private message to the bot, room admins can also use:

```text
,idlerpg on
,idlerpg off
,idlerpg status
```

By default, new rooms have IdleRPG disabled:

```python
ROOM_PLUGIN_DEFAULTS = {
    "idlerpg": False,
}
```

## Player commands

Use these in the game room or from a MUC private message to the bot:

```text
,idlerpg register <character> <class>
,idlerpg status [character]
,idlerpg whoami
,idlerpg top [page|last|all]
,idlerpg players [page|last|all]
,idlerpg items [character]
,idlerpg align <good|neutral|evil>
,idlerpg quest
,idlerpg login
,idlerpg logout
,idlerpg remove-me
```

Aliases:

```text
,irpg ...
,idle ...
```

Examples:

```text
,idlerpg register Sven sysadmin
,idlerpg status
,idlerpg top
,idlerpg items Sven
,idlerpg align good
```

## How leveling works

A player levels up when their time-to-level reaches zero.

The default level timer follows the classic IdleRPG formula:

```text
TTL = rp_base * (rp_step ** current_level)
```

Defaults:

```python
IDLERPG = {
    "rp_base": 600,
    "rp_step": 1.16,
}
```

While the player is online in the room and not explicitly logged out, the bot
subtracts elapsed idle time from the timer on every game tick.

## Penalties

Normal room messages penalize registered players. By default, bot commands are
not counted as penalty messages.

```python
IDLERPG = {
    "message_penalty": 1,
    "penalty_step": 1.14,
    "logout_penalty": 20,
    "max_penalty": 604800,
    "count_command_messages": False,
}
```

The penalty formula is:

```text
penalty = base_penalty * (penalty_step ** current_level)
```

`max_penalty` caps a single penalty event. Set it to `0` to disable the cap.

## Random events and items

On level-up, the player may find an item.

The game loop can also trigger rare random events:

- calamities add time to a player's timer
- godsends remove time from a player's timer

Relevant settings:

```python
IDLERPG = {
    "event_chance": 0.01,
    "item_chance": 0.20,
}
```

## Quests

When enough online players have reached the configured minimum level, the bot can
start a room quest. Quest completion removes 25% of the participating players'
remaining timer burden.

Relevant settings:

```python
IDLERPG = {
    "quest_min_level": 40,
    "quest_interval": 21600,
    "quest_min_duration": 43200,
    "quest_max_duration": 86400,
}
```

## Admin commands

Room moderators/admins can adjust characters:

```text
,idlerpg push <character> <duration>
,idlerpg setlevel <character> <level>
,idlerpg reset <character>
,idlerpg delete <character>
```

Examples:

```text
,idlerpg push Sven 10m
,idlerpg setlevel Sven 12
,idlerpg reset Sven
,idlerpg delete Sven
```

## Diagnostics

IdleRPG exposes runtime state for plugin diagnostics:

```text
,plugins state idlerpg
,plugins state idlerpg <room_jid>
```

The state includes room count, player count, online player count, active quests
and running game-loop tasks.

The supervised game-loop tasks are also visible through:

```text
,tasks
,tasks all
```
